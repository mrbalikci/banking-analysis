"What is the relationship between poverty, age, and population with the number of banks in a given area?"

### Details 
  
* The task is to randomly sample a set of 700+ zip codes from the US `Census_Data.csv` and then utilize both the Google Geocoder and Radar APIs to identify the number of banks in each of these zip codes within a 5 mile radius of a given point. 
  
* The data saved as `output/zip_bank_data.csv`
  
* The saved data analyzed by series of scatter plots comparing each of the following:

* Per Capita Income vs. Bank Count

* Poverty Rate vs. Bank Count

* The plots were saved in `output` folder.
